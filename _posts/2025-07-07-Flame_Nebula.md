title: "Flame Nebula"
author: "Astrae Team"
description: "This emission nebula encompasses a young cluster of stars, including at least one hot, massive O-type star that emits high-energy photons. These photons ionize hydrogen and other atoms into ions and electrons, producing a flame-like spectacle in the sky upon their recombination. The bright star Alnitak, part of Orionâ€™s Belt, can be seen toward the lower right of the nebula in this image. Captured from the Challakere campus of IISc using a 200 mm lens and a DSLR camera with an exposure time of ~2 hours."
