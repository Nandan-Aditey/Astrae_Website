title: Flame Nebula
author: Astrae Team
description: >
                This emission nebula encompasses a young cluster of stars with at least one hot, massive O-type star which emits high-energy photons, ionizing hydrogen and other atoms into ions and electrons, thereby producing a flame-like spectacle in the sky upon their recombination. The bright star Alnitak of the Orionâ€™s belt can be seen towards the lower-right of the nebula in this image. 
                Captured from the Challakere campus of IISc using a 200 mm lens and a DSLR camera with an exposure time of ~2 hours.
