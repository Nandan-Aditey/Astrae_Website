description: >
  The face of our nearest neighbour, the Moon, has its own story to tell – a story of our solar system 
  right from its infancy. The large dark patches are thought to have resulted from asteroid impacts 
  during the early days of the Moon’s formation, while the smaller craters scattered all around, 
  visible especially near the illumination edge (called the ‘lunar terminator’), are from more recent 
  low-energy impacts. Since the Moon has no atmosphere, these footprints of evolution have never 
  eroded away. The glancing incidence of sunlight near the lunar terminator makes features like 
  crater rims and central hills easily identifiable.
  Captured from the IISc Bengaluru campus using an 8-inch Newtonian telescope and a DSLR camera. 
  It is a low-ISO single-shot image.
