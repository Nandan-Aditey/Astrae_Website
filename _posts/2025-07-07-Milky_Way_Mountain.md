  A Path of Light in the Heavens – The Aakaash Ganga: This image is a long-exposure photograph 
  of what undoubtedly is one of the most surreal scenes visible to the naked human eye – that of our 
  own galaxy, the Milky Way. Despite being spiral in shape like the Andromeda Galaxy, it appears as a 
  hazy glowing band from the Earth because our view is from within this disc. With the invention of the 
  telescope, we realized that this glow is the result of a large density of stars present in the disc. 
  Alas, an overwhelming majority of the present-day population live under light polluted skies and have 
  not had the privilege of viewing the Milky Way even once in their lifetimes!
  Captured from Ladakh using a 35 mm lens and a DSLR camera with an exposure time of ~6 minutes.
