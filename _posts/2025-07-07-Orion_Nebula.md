title: Orion Nebula (M42)
author: Astrae Team
description: >
  Orion Nebula (M42): The nearest stellar nursery to us, the Orion Nebula, is a vast cosmic cloud of gas and dust collapsing into baby stars. This nebular complex is rich in molecular gas, an ideal condition for star formation. The gas in the Running Man Nebula (top) is illuminated by the light from the star cluster within it. The nebula and its surrounding regions have been extensively studied and has led to several ground-breaking advances in our understanding of star formation in the universe.
  Captured from the IISc Bengaluru campus using a 600 mm lens and a DSLR camera with an exposure time of ~2 hours.
