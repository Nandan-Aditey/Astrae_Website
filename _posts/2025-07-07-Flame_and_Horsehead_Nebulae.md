title: Flame and Horsehead Nebulae
author: Astrae Team
description: >
                A dense molecular cloud shaped like the head of a horse, the Horsehead Nebula (slightly to the right of the centre) is a cradle for newborn and young stars. It is a dark nebula – a molecular cloud so dense that it obscures light from objects behind it, such as background stars and emission or reflection nebulae. Slightly to the left of the centre is the Flame Nebula – an emission nebula encompassing a young cluster of stars with at least one hot, massive O-type star which emits high-energy photons, ionizing hydrogen and other atoms into ions and electrons, thereby producing a flame-like spectacle in the sky upon their recombination. Casper the Friendly Ghost Nebula (M78) – a reflection nebula – can be seen near the bottom left corner of the image, along with many other nebulous objects.
                Captured from the Challakere campus of IISc using a 200 mm lens and a DSLR camera with an exposure time of ~2 hours.
