title: "Flame and Horsehead Nebulae"
author: Astrae Team
description: >
  A dense molecular cloud shaped like the head of a horse, the Horsehead Nebula 
  (slightly right of center) serves as a cradle for newborn and young stars. It is a dark 
  nebulaâ€”a cloud so dense that it obscures light from background stars and other nebulae. 
  Slightly left of center lies the Flame Nebula, an emission nebula surrounding a young 
  cluster of stars. At least one hot, massive O-type star within emits high-energy photons, 
  ionizing hydrogen and other atoms, creating a flame-like glow upon recombination.
  Near the bottom-left corner is Casper the Friendly Ghost Nebula (M78), a reflection nebula, 
  along with many other nebulous objects scattered throughout the frame.
  Captured from the Challakere campus of IISc using a 200 mm lens and a DSLR camera with 
  an exposure time of ~2 hours.
