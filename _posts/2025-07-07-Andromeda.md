title: "The Andromeda Galaxy (Messier 31 or M31)"
author: "Astrae Team"
description: "The Andromeda Galaxy (Messier 31 or M31) is the sister galaxy of our own Milky Way and the closest major galaxy in our cosmic neighborhoodâ€”the Local Group. Its bright central bulge is surrounded by lanes of dust, gas, and trillions of stars. Also visible in this image are its two satellite galaxies: M110 (bottom-left of the core) and M32 (left and slightly above the core, near the edge of the disk). Captured from Ladakh using a 135 mm lens and a DSLR camera with an exposure time of ~34 minutes."
