                The Andromeda Galaxy (Messier 31 or M31): The so-called sister of our galaxy, the 
                Milky Way. It is our closest neighbour in the cosmic neighbourhood, the ‘Local Group’
                of galaxies. The galactic core appears as a bright central bulge surrounded by lanes of 
                dust, gas, and trillions of stars. The two satellite galaxies – M110 (bottom left of the core)
                and M32 (left and slightly to the top of the core, near the edge of the disk) – are also 
                visible in this image.
                Captured from Ladakh using a 135 mm lens and a DSLR camera with an exposure time 
                of ~34 minutes.
