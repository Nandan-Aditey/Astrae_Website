                This starry image includes both the Owl Cluster and the constellation Cassiopeia. The Owl Cluster is bright enough to be observed even under mildly light-polluted skies. Captured from the Challakere campus of IISc using a 200 mm lens and a DSLR camera with an exposure time of ~33 minutes.
