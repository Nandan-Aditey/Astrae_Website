description: >
  In the summer night sky runs a milky stream of starsâ€“the band of our 
  home galaxy, the Milky Way. Hundreds of billions of stars shine like a river of milk 
  flowing through the vast cosmic expanse. The dark patches in this stream are a result of 
  the absorption of starlight by interstellar clouds of dust. What we perceive of the Milky 
  Way in the night sky is an edge-on projection of its spiral disc, like how an ant would 
  observe a large circular disk while perched upon it. Our Sun is in one of its spiral arms, 
  the Orion Arm, at about 25,000 light-years from the centre.
  Captured from the Challakere campus of IISc using an 18 mm lens and a DSLR camera
  with an exposure time of ~18 minutes.
