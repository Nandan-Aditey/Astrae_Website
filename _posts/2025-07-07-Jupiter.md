                The King of Planets and His Four Consorts: Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar 
                system, along with its four Galilean moons (named after their discoverer Galileo Galilei)
                â€“ (from left to right) Europa, Io Ganymede, and Callisto. It is a gas giant having clouds of 
                ammonia and water floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium, which forms 
                magnificent reddish-brown bands at multiple latitudes. The Great Red Spot, visible near 
                the lower left periphery of the planetary disc, is the largest storm in the solar system,
                having a diameter larger than that of the Earth!
                Captured from the IISc Bengaluru campus using an 8-inch Newtonian telescope and a 
                CCD camera with an exposure time of ~29 seconds.
