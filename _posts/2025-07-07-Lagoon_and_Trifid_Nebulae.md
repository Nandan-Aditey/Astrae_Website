title: Lagoon (M8) and Trifid (M20) Nebulae
author: Astrae Team
description: >
  In the dark skies, sandwiched between two dust lanes of the Milky Way (Top-Right and Bottom-Left). 
  Located in the constellation Sagittarius, the Lagoon Nebula (M8) is the largest and the brightest one 
  in the image. A giant emission nebula composed of glowing ionized gas being heated by several stars 
  housed at its core. The other nebulous object seen above the Lagoon Nebula is the Trifid Nebula (M20). 
  This curious object is an open cluster of stars within and shows all three types of nebulosity. 
  The region seen blue is the reflection nebula (gas and dust visible to us due to it reflecting the light 
  of stars), the region in red is an emission nebula (ionized gas visible to us due to the light it emits). 
  Additionally, dust lanes intersect the nebulosity (the dark nebula), creating a three-lobed shape 
  (hence named Trifid). Just above and slightly to the right of the Trifid Nebula, there is a noticeable 
  area with a substantially high stellar density. This is the open cluster M21.
  Captured from Ladakh using a 200 mm lens and a DSLR camera with an exposure time of ~2 hours.
